# Grid away, grid ahoy !

###### made on July 5th, 2021

Explanation:
-------------
We have made a design in HTML and CSS using the grid attribut in CSS.

HTML issues:
-------------
When I use section tag with the class attribute, the grid isn't display as it should be. So, I've made 8 sections with a div tag with the class attribute. 

It was my only issue in the HTML code.

CSS issues:
------------
The biggest issue was to center the elements in my cards. I didn't understand how to make it. So after a little help, the solution was to use the flew property in the item class. 

Responsive issues:
------------------
No huge responsive issue. Just an adjust of the height for p tag and for the item class in max 300px.
